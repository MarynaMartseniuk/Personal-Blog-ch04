# Personal-Blog-ch04
### Motivation to create this Web-App was a wish to have a personal blog so that I can showcase my thoughts and experiences.
### I built this Web-App because it had a lot coding challanges neede to be solved. For me, as for a begginer, it was importent to get a new skills and got understanding that "I can do it!".
### This Web-App takes input from user (notes, thoughts), then saves it to Local Storage and displays all data from Local Storage to another page. So as user you can see all your notes on one page.
### This project was interesting and usefull for me because, as a begginer, I learned:
- basics of Local Storage;
- trained my CSS skills;
- learned how to manadge style using JavaScript;
- learned how to switch in between pages;
- practiced to apply Light/Dark mode.
### This project may be not a unique for the World, but It is for me. It is shows that I can work with technology that is widely used in mordern life (This project is an example of social Apps, that people use a lot at today's time).
